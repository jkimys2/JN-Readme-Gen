# JN-Readme-Gen

## Description

Through this project, I was able to create a README file generator. Once in the integrated terminal, users are prompted questions on how they would like to build their README file. This challenge was completed by following the acceptance criterias listed below:


```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

This project was built using Inquirer as well as Node.js. It was created to help others create a quality README file with well-structured guidelines. A sample README file is available for viewing in the output folder!

There was starter code provided for this project. Those files were used in order to build this README generator.


## Installation

In order to create your own quality README file, you will need the following:

- Visual Studio Code <br>
- Node.js


## Usage

Once you have the files in VS Code, you will need to install the Inquirer package. Once that is done, open the Integrated Terminal. In the terminal, you will need to run "node index.js" in order to start the prompts. Once you go through all of the questions, your new README file will be created in the output folder!

Here is a snippet on how this README generator works:
